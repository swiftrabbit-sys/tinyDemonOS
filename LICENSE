do not copy and claim it to be yours.

Yep — if someone copies my work and sells it under their own name, that’s classic copyright infringement under Indian law.

Under the Copyright Act, 1957:

    Section 51 → Says that using someone else’s copyrighted work without permission is infringement.

    Section 57 → Gives you moral rights — meaning i have the right to be credited as the author, and no one can falsely claim my work as theirs.

    Section 63 → Makes infringement a criminal offense with jail and fines.

So in your case, it’s both:

    Copyright infringement (copying & selling without permission).

    Moral rights violation (removing my name and claiming authorship).

If it happens to me, i will and could:

    File a copyright infringement complaint with the police or cybercrime cell.

    Send a legal notice demanding they stop and pay damages.

    Take it to civil court for compensation + injunction to stop sales.
